      <h1>Can I create recurring events in the Basecamp calendar? What about recurring todo items?</h1>
      <p>
        Hello!
      </p>
      <p>My name is Jean and I'll be happy to help you out today.</p>
      <p>
        Basecamp 2 and 3 calendars do have the option of automating recurring events. Please click on the following options
        for step-by-step instructions on how to set up recurring events:<br />
        For <a href="https://2.basecamp-help.com/article/223-recurring-events" target="_blank">Basecamp 2</a><br />
        For <a href="https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/49-schedule#recurring-events" target="_blank">Basecamp 3</a><br />
        Basecamp Classic does not offer the feature of automated recurring events at this time. However, you can add it
        manually each time you want it to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        For recurring tasks, Basecamp does not have this feature implemented, but there is downloadable software that can
        easily be integrated with your Basecamp 3 account:
        <a href="https://app.todohelpers.com/" target="_blank">"To-do Helpers"</a> is a great app that will help automate
        recurring to-do lists so you won't have to do it manually.
        <a href="https://www.recurhq.com/" target="_blank">"Recur"</a> is another tool for Basecamp 3 that will help manage
        your to-do lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any other questions or concerns, please reach out and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you
        for your time!
