      <h1>Does Basecamp 3 offer time tracking?</h1>
      <p>
        Hi there. Thank you for reaching out to our Customer Support team.<br />
        My name is Jean and I'd be happy to assist you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basecamp 3 does indeed offer time tracking using 3rd party tools. If you click on this
        <a href="https://basecamp.com/extras" target="_blank">link</a>, it will take you to our site that lists out all the
        time tracking software under the "Time-tracking, Invoicing, and Accounting" section. Your company may be using some
        of these software already, but each one prioritizes different aspects of management and they will all be integrated
        with your Basecamp account, making it an easy and efficient transition.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to let me know and I'll get back to as soon as
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you!</p>
      <p>
