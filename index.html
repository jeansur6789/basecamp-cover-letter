      <h2 id="section1">Why I want to work in Customer Support</h2>
      <p>
        I have been serving others for the past 7 years as a piano instructor, office administrator, and customer care
        manager and it has been an incredible and eye-opening journey so far. Each stage in life has taught me valuable life
        lessons about people, genuineness, and conflict, but they all led to the same conclusion: I just love to help!
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be an amazing opportunity to be part of Basecamp’s customer support team so I can do what I love amongst
        those who are passionate about it as well. Whether it may be personal or technical issues, I invest 100% of my
        efforts to helping others with compassion and empathy. I have no problem expressing when I don’t have the answer
        right away, but I do try my best to come up with a solution as quickly as possible. I am not afraid of hard work or
        confrontation, because I have learned why it is important to be focused, thick-skinned, and considerate during those
        compromising situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        But amidst the aforementioned, I love being in customer support because I don’t want anyone to be afraid of asking
        questions. As a child, I remember the fear of asking a “dumb” question, so I learned to keep questions to myself. I
        strive to break that stigma; rather bring kindness, graciousness, and knowledge to this world and encourage people to
        ask freely. All in all, I can’t think of a better way to spend my day than helping others in need.

        Why I want to work at Basecamp and not somewhere else
      </h2>
      <p>
        Basecamp offers an incredible product that helps companies stay on top of their organization and communication. It is
        very impressive and obvious why customers stay loyal to Basecamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        But my desire to work for Basecamp is not due to the praise of the product, but rather the integrity of the company.
        Basecamp is one of the few companies I have come across that not only cares, but is passionate about their customers'
        satisfaction and needs. A human touch goes into all aspects of this company and it starts with customer support. It
        is no secret that Basecamp prides itself in the individuals that work here. And it is also apparent that everyone is
        excited to be here. Basecamp operates with nurture and care and appreciates what each individual brings to the table.
        A lot of companies out there are beyond impressive, but I’d love to serve and be part of a community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working at a company that genuinely cares for people, encourages individuality, and to learn the responsibilities and
        beauties of working in a tight-knit community would be a dream come true.
      </p>

        A description of a great customer service/support experience I had recently and what made it great
      </h2>
      <p>
        I wasn't able to spend Father's Day with my dad this year, so my husband and I decided to order a Harry & David food
        basket for him. Upon checkout, I forgot to click on the "expedited shipping" option to ensure it arrived before
        Father's Day, so I emailed their customer support and received a reply shortly after. They said they'll have someone
        contact me once the problem was fixed, but instead I received a shipping confirmation showing the basket would arrive
        after Father's Day.
      </p>
      <p>
        After expressing my frustration, they offered to expedite a second basket to meet my deadline. It was great that they
        salvaged the situation by giving me 2 baskets for the price of 1, but that's not necessarily what made this
        experience special. Harry and David's products can sell themselves, but I could tell how much their customers'
        satisfaction means to them. They apologized many times for their lack of communication, and encouraged me to reach
        out if I had any other concerns. A manager contacted me after the initial hiccup, and I was in full communication
        with her throughout the rest of the process. It helped to have one person of contact and she'd respond within 30
        minutes everytime. Their overall tone was genuine and helpful which is what made a lasting impression. It's almost
        like I can put a personality on the company now.

        A time I taught myself a new skill to complete a job or project
      </h2>
      <p>
        Well, this website!
      </p>
      <p>
        I had taken a basic coding workshop in the past, and I thought it would be fun to recreate Basecamp's website for
        this application. I took some HTML/CSS courses from Treehouse and I was even able to dabble in some UX Design
        courses, which helped me create my own little Basecamp logo.
      </p>
      <p>
        I inspected Basecamp's code and realized it wouldn't be impossible to recreate, so I started from the top and made my
        way down the page. I downloaded the images and font and tried to copy as much of the initial code as I could.
        Whenever I didn't understand something, I would google search and often times be led to Stack Overflow.
      </p>
      <p>
        What helped me kickstart this task was how Treehouse incorporated a user interface where I had to complete some
        coding challenges in between lessons. Kinesthetic learning is my preferred method, so it helped me realize what I
        needed more work on and what details I had missed entirely. It was one of the hardest projects I had to do since high
        school physics, but I’m very proud that I was able to make this website.

      <h2 id="section5">A guide to making my favorite meal</h2>
      <p>
        Kimchi Fried Rice has been a staple of my childhood and it's still one of my all-time favorites. This is one of the
        easiest, fastest meals, and needs minimal ingredients. You could mix it up with bacon or beef, but I like to use the
        ever controversial, spam. The popular choice seems to be a fried egg on top, but my husband loves an over-easy egg,
        so that's an option for you as well!
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll need:
      </p>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>2 cups of steamed white rice</li>
        <li>1 cup of kimchi</li>
        <li>1/2 can of spam</li>
        <li>Sesame oil OR butter</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>LET'S GET STARTED!!</em>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Chop the spam into little cubes and then the kimchi into little bite sizes. Save the juice that comes out of the
          kimchi for later.
          <em
            >(It doesn't matter how big you cut the pieces, it's more about your preferred bite size. But the spam has a lot
            of flavor so I like to make them smaller than my kimchi.)</em
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the spam into a frying pan and stir for about 3 minutes until the spam starts to get a little brown. Then, add
          the kimchi, without the juice, into the frying pan. Stir together for another 1-2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add your steamed rice into the frying pan and pour the juice on top of the rice.
          <em>(I recommend 1/4 cup of kimchi juice as too much will result in soggy rice. Boo)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour 1 tablespoon of sesame oil into the frying pan. If you don't have sesame oil, you can add 1.5 tablespoons of
          butter instead.
          <em>(Butter's a great substitute that doesn't compromise the flavor!)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir thoroughly for 3 minutes so the juice and oil (butter) can spread evenly.
        </li>
        <li>Serve in a bowl and add your egg on top.</li>
        <li>
          Enjoy! Share with a friend or stash delicious leftovers for yourself.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong> Congrats, you have just made super easy and tasty kimchi fried rice :)</strong>
